I am a security researcher with over 20yrs of experience within the InfoSec community. Through my career I have evaluated the Threat Vector of numerous organizations from both the defensive and offensive perspectives. After trying numerous hats, I grew a passion for hardware, IoT, and purpose build / kiosk based platforms. My research in this space has awareded me several MITRE CVE and enabled me to conduct non-testimonial expert witness activities in the realm of ATM security.

The goal of this blog is to provide back to the security community and free myself from corporate opinions. The content contained within are TTPs and insight I have gained through my career. I hope you enjoy and follow - feel free to [contact](/card.html) if you have any comments or questions.
